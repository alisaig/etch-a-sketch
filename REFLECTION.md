# The Odin Project: Etch-a-Sketch

Doing this project taught me a lot about using event listeners, applying css styles through javascript and how to shape the DOM using javascript in general.

I also learned about how removing event listeners works and that you can replace an event listener with another one within the same function, which is something I was unaware of. I wanted to use this logic to run a certain function on the first mouseover over an element and then another one on all the subsequent mouseovers. In the end, however, I ended up with a different and simpler solution to solve this problem that didn't require deleting any event listeners. I still found it a valuable lesson though for the future.

Another lesson for me was that you can use variables in css, with values taken from the javascript file. In my final solution I did not do this and directly applied the styles from the js file instead, but I'll try doing it a different way in the future. By using variables in css I'll be able to keep the styling to the css file so the entire project is more organized in general.
